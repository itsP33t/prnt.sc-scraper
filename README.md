# Prnt.sc scraper

## **About**
### This tool uses the prnt.sc to download random images. Some images may be cool, but remeber, use vpn or at least proxy because prnt.sc can see your ip and they can ban you. Second thing is that there is lot of scam images. They trick you into thinking that you found some password to bitcoin wallet but the truth is that the site is scam.
